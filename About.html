                My name is <strong>Lesibana Maitisa</strong>, and I am an Information Technology student with a growing passion for the world of computing and digital innovation. Throughout this academic year, I have developed a strong understanding of how technology can be used to solve real-life problems and improve communication, efficiency, and access to information.

                Through various practical projects and coursework, I have gained essential skills in several areas of IT. These include Java programming, where I learned to create and manage classes, objects, and arrays; web development using HTML and CSS, which allowed me to design and structure functional web pages; and Python programming, where I explored how to use lists, loops, and logical operations to process data. In addition, I have developed skills in debugging, testing, and troubleshooting, which have helped me understand the importance of accuracy and attention to detail in software development.

                These experiences have also strengthened my problem-solving, teamwork, and communication abilities, as many of the projects required collaboration and clear planning. My goal as an emerging IT professional is to continue improving my technical knowledge while exploring areas such as software development, database management, and cybersecurity.

                I am motivated to keep learning and to apply my knowledge in ways that contribute positively to the advancement of technology. My long-term ambition is to become a skilled and innovative IT professional who creates solutions that make a meaningful difference in society.
